### Final Project Status Checklist

Before you close your laptop, here is a quick check of your secure, optimized folder:

* **`app.py`**: Handles logic, session timeout (10 mins), and brute force protection (2s delay).
* **`data_handler.py`**: Fetches 7 tabs and caches data for 10 mins to prevent overheating.
* **`.env`**: Stores your passwords and Google Sheet links privately.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists your dependencies.
* **`templates/`**: Contains `login.html` and `search.html`.
